Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset from Kaggle website to predict its survival rate based on the independent & dependant variables.
Applied Label as well as one hot encoding to the necessary columns.
Applied Feature Scaling using MinMaxScalar() method.
Checked for the balanced dataset using SMOTE method.
Trained the model using Train-Test Split method.
Eventually build the model using Logistic Regression & calculated its accuracy, precision & recall score.
